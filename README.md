# Faster Than Light

A lightspeed portal disabling tool for MacOS 


![Logo](https://github.com/JOOT49/FasterThanLight/blob/main/AppIcon.jpg?raw=true)


## Installation

Install FasterThanLight with the packaged ```.app``` file. When opening the app for the first time, a popup may appear saying that apple cannot check for malware, to get around this, just right click the app and press open. 

On first launch it may ask if it can control system events, select YES otherwise the app wont be able to modify the lightspeed client.


## How does this work?

It literally just kills the launch agent for Lightspeed, and makes sure it stays dead.


## Contributing

Contributions are always welcome!

This is an app that was originally a shell script file, that i sloppily ported to a proper app through the application maker "Platypus", any and all contributions to make this less terrible will be very appreciated.
